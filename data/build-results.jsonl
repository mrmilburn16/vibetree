It should mainly be a camera screen like facetime, but have a number of pushups number that's easy to read from say 6-8 feet away while i'm doing the pushups. the counter needs to update live and it should be looking at my motion to detect when a pushup is done. be creative as well and add in a few more screens that would be useful for the user. maybe one screen shows the history of how many pushups they did by day, maybe goals, how close they are to hitting their goals like a little bar thing that shows how much was completed. like if a user wants 20 pushups in a day and they did 15 that day, it would fill the par 75% to reflect this.","tier":"custom","category":"","compiled":true,"attempts":1,"autoFixUsed":false,"compilerErrors":[],"fileCount":11,"fileNames":["App.swift","Models/PushupRecord.swift","Models/GoalSettings.swift","ViewModels/AppViewModel.swift","ViewModels/PushupDetector.swift","Views/MainTabView.swift","Views/CameraWorkoutView.swift","Views/CameraPreviewView.swift","Views/CameraManager.swift","Views/HistoryView.swift","Views/GoalsView.swift"],"durationMs":633754}
