**Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)**

```
Build an app with error handling UI patterns. Main screen: 3 sections. Section 1: 'No Internet' state with retry button that succeeds on second try. Section 2: 'Server Error' with error code, message, and retry/report buttons. Section 3: 'Not Found' with search suggestion and home button. Each retry shows loading then success. Error animations (shake, fade). Toast notifications for recoverable errors.
