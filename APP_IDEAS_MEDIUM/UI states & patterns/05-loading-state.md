**Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)**

```
Build an app demonstrating loading patterns. Main screen: 4 cards, each showing a different loading style. Card 1: spinner with label. Card 2: progress bar (0–100% over 3 seconds). Card 3: skeleton loading (gray shimmer rectangles that reveal content). Card 4: pull-to-refresh list. Reload button triggers all loading states simultaneously. Show success state after each loads.
