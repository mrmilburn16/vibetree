# Onboarding flow (Medium)

**Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)**

```
Build a 5-screen onboarding with progress. Horizontal paging with page indicator dots and progress bar. Each page: illustration placeholder, title, subtitle. Page 3: permission prompt (notifications toggle). Page 4: preference picker (choose interests from a grid). Last page: Get Started and Skip buttons. Animated transitions between pages. Remember completion state in UserDefaults so onboarding only shows once.
```
