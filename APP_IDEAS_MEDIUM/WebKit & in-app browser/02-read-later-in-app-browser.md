# Read-later + in-app browser (Medium)

**Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)**

```
Build a read-later app with tabs. Tab 1: list of saved articles (title, URL, date added) with search bar and swipe actions (delete, mark as read). Tab 2: reading list filtered to unread only. Tapping opens WKWebView with a toolbar (back, forward, share, mark read). Add article sheet with URL field and optional title. Persist with Codable + UserDefaults. Show unread badge count on tab.
```
