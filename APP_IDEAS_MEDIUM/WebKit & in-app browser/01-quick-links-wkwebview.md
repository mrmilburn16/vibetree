# Quick links + WKWebView (Medium)

**Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)**

```
Build a quick links app with NavigationStack. Main screen: searchable list of saved links grouped by category (e.g. Social, News, Work). Tap opens a detail screen with WKWebView (UIViewRepresentable) loading that URL, plus a share button and a favorite toggle. Add/edit link form with title, URL, and category picker. Persist with Codable + UserDefaults. Include pull-to-refresh and swipe-to-delete.
```
