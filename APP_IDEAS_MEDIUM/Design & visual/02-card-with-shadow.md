# Card with shadow (Medium)

**Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)**

```
Build a card-based UI showcase. Main screen: scrollable list of card styles — minimal (subtle shadow), elevated (pronounced shadow), outlined (border, no shadow), gradient (gradient background), image (photo placeholder with text overlay). Each card is tappable and expands with animation to detail view. Settings: toggle between light and dark card themes. Drag to reorder cards. Custom shadow color matches card accent. Persist order with UserDefaults.
