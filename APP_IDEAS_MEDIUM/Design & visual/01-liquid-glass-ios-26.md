# Liquid Glass (iOS 26) (Medium)

**Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)**

```
Build a Liquid Glass style app with multiple screens. Main screen: frosted glass cards (using iOS 26 glassEffect if available, or blur + transparency fallback) showing dashboard stats. Navigation to detail screen with glass-morphism header. Settings sheet with glass-style grouped controls. Tab bar with glass background. Dynamic background that shifts color slowly. Proper light/dark adaptation. Smooth spring animations on all transitions.
