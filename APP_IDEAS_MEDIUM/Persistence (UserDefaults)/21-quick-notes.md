Build a quick notes app with tags. Main screen: list of notes with title preview and colored tag dots. Add note sheet: text field and tag picker (Important, Idea, Reminder — each with a color). Filter by tag using horizontal scroll chips. Search bar. Swipe to delete or pin. Pinned notes appear at top. Timestamp on each note. Persist with Codable + UserDefaults.
