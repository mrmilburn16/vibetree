# Single-metric tracker (Medium)

**Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)**

```
Build a multi-metric dashboard. Main screen: list of tracked metrics (e.g. Weight, Steps, Pages Read), each showing current value and trend arrow (up/down). Tap metric for detail: history list, min/max/average stats, and a simple line chart placeholder. Add metric sheet: name, unit, and starting value. Log new value with date. Persist with Codable + UserDefaults.
```
