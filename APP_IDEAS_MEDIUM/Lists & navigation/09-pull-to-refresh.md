**Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)**

```
Build a feed app with pull-to-refresh. Main screen: list of posts (author, text, timestamp, like count). Pull to refresh adds new mock posts at top with animation. Like button toggles with count. Tap post for detail with comments section (mock data). Floating compose button opens new post sheet. Show relative timestamps (2m ago, 1h ago). Persist posts with Codable + UserDefaults.
