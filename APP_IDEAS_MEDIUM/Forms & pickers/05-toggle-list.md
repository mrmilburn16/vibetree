```
Build a feature flags manager. Main screen: sectioned list of feature toggles grouped by category (UI, Performance, Experimental). Each toggle has title, description, and status indicator. Some toggles have dependencies (enabling A auto-enables B). Warning sheet when disabling critical features. Search toggles. Export current config (share sheet). Persist all with UserDefaults.
