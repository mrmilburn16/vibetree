# Skeleton loading (Medium)

**Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)**

```
Build a social feed with skeleton loading. Main screen: on launch, show 5 skeleton rows (shimmer animation on gray rectangles for avatar, title, body, and image). After 2 seconds, animate to real content (posts with avatar initial, username, text, timestamp, and like/comment counts). Pull-to-refresh triggers skeleton again. Error state if refresh fails (mock toggle). Infinite scroll simulation (load 5 more with skeletons).
```
