Build a calendar with events. Main screen: month view grid with navigation (prev/next month, today button). Dots on dates with events. Tap date: list of events for that day below the calendar. Add event sheet: title, time, color picker, notes. Week view toggle. Event detail with edit/delete. Current day highlighted. Animated month transitions. Persist events with Codable + UserDefaults.
