## Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)

```
Build a simple note editor app. One screen: a list of saved notes (show title only). Tapping a note opens an editor screen with a text field for the title and a TextEditor for the body. Include a Save button and a back/cancel. Empty state: “Add note” button that creates a new note and opens the editor. Store notes in memory or UserDefaults. Use NavigationStack and system styling.
