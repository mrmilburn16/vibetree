# 6. Home screen widget: daily quote or goal

**Showcases:** Single focus screen, persistence (widget extension later).

**MVP:** One screen: text field to set today’s quote or goal, Save, and a large display of the current quote.

## Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)

```
Build a daily quote or goal app. One screen: at the top a text field to enter today’s quote or goal and a Save button. Below, display the current quote/goal in large, readable typography (centered or card). If none saved yet, show placeholder text like “Set your daily focus above.” Persist the quote in UserDefaults so it survives app restarts. Clean, minimal layout.
```
