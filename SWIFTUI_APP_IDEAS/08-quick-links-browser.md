## Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)

```
Build a quick links app. One screen: a list of saved links with titles (e.g. Apple Developer, SwiftUI Docs). Tapping a row opens a second screen with a WebKit web view (WKWebView via UIViewRepresentable) loading that URL. Navigation bar shows the page title and has a back button. Include 2–3 default links so the app works immediately. Store custom links in UserDefaults; allow adding a new link (title + URL).
```
