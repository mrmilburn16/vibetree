## Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)

```
Build a focus block timer. One screen: a text field for the block name (e.g. “Deep work”), a duration picker with options 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes, and a Start button. When running, show a large countdown (minutes and seconds) and a Stop button. Below the timer, a list of recent focus blocks (name, duration, date). Use a card or rounded rectangle for the timer area. Store recent blocks in memory or UserDefaults. Clean, productivity-style UI.
```
