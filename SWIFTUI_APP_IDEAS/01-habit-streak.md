# 1. Habit streak with Liquid Glass cards

**Showcases:** Liquid Glass (`.glassEffect()`), SwiftUI animations.

**MVP:** One screen: list of habits, each as a card with name, streak count, and check-in button. Tapping check-in animates and increments the streak.

## Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)

```
Build a habit tracker with Liquid Glass design. One screen: a list of habits (e.g. Exercise, Read, Meditate). Each habit is a card showing its name, current streak count, and a “Check in” button. Use iOS 26 and .glassEffect() on the cards. When the user taps Check in, animate the update and increment the streak. Store streaks in memory or UserDefaults. Include an option to add a new habit.
