**Showcases:** WebKit in SwiftUI, list + detail, navigation.

**MVP:** List of saved URLs; tapping one opens an in-app web view with back button.

## Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)

```
Build a read-later app with an in-app browser. One screen: a list of saved URLs (each row shows title and URL). Tapping a row opens a second screen with a WebKit web view (WKWebView in UIViewRepresentable) loading that URL. Add a back button in the navigation bar to return to the list. Include a way to add a new URL (e.g. plus button with a simple form: title and URL). Store the list in UserDefaults or memory.
```
