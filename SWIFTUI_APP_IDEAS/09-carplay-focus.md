## Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)

```
Build a minimal “today’s focus” app with a CarPlay-friendly layout. One screen: a large title at the top (e.g. “Today’s Focus”), one prominent card or button in the center showing the main focus item (e.g. “Ship the prototype”), and below that a simple list of 3 focus items. Use large, bold typography and high contrast so the layout is easy to read at a glance. No small text. Minimal chrome.
```
