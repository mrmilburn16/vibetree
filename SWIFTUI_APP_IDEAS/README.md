# SwiftUI app ideas

10 app ideas that showcase SwiftUI features. Each idea has its own file with a **copy-paste MVP prompt** you can paste into the Vibetree editor (Pro / Swift) to build the app.

| # | App | File | Feature |
|---|-----|------|---------|
| 1 | Habit streak cards | [01-habit-streak.md](01-habit-streak.md) | Liquid Glass, animations |
| 2 | Finance dashboard | [02-finance-dashboard.md](02-finance-dashboard.md) | Swift Charts |
| 3 | Rich-text recipe/note | [03-rich-text-note.md](03-rich-text-note.md) | AttributedString, editor |
| 4 | Read-later browser | [04-read-later-browser.md](04-read-later-browser.md) | WebKit for SwiftUI |
| 5 | Meditation timer | [05-meditation-timer.md](05-meditation-timer.md) | Timer, Live Activity-ready |
| 6 | Daily quote/goal | [06-daily-quote.md](06-daily-quote.md) | Widget-ready |
| 7 | Mood journal | [07-mood-journal.md](07-mood-journal.md) | Declarative animations |
| 8 | Quick links browser | [08-quick-links-browser.md](08-quick-links-browser.md) | WebKit, list + detail |
| 9 | CarPlay-style focus | [09-carplay-focus.md](09-carplay-focus.md) | CarPlay-friendly layout |
| 10 | Focus block timer | [10-focus-block.md](10-focus-block.md) | Materials, timer |

**Tips:** Use **Pro (Swift)** in the editor. Paste the prompt from the file, send, then use “Download for Xcode” to run on device. For Liquid Glass, add “Use Liquid Glass design” to the prompt or as a follow-up.
