## Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)

```
Build a personal finance dashboard with Swift Charts. One screen: a bar chart showing income vs spending for the last 7 days (use sample data like 3 income and 4 spending values). Below the chart, a list of recent transactions (title and amount, positive green and negative red). At the top, a savings goal progress view (e.g. “$200 / $1000”). Use SwiftUI Chart for the bar chart. Keep data in memory or a simple model.
