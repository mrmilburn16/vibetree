## Prompt (copy-paste into Vibetree Pro)

```

Build a meditation or focus timer. One screen: a duration picker (e.g. 5, 10, 15 minutes), a Start button, and when running a large countdown display showing remaining time (minutes and seconds) plus a Stop button. When the timer finishes, show an alert or message “Session complete” and reset. Use a Timer or DispatchQueue to update the countdown every second. Simple, calm styling. Add live activity and ensure this part works fully
